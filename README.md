## 💡 What is the Glow Hack in XDefiant?

The **Glow Hack** is a visual-based cheat that outlines enemy players with a glowing highlight, even through walls and obstacles. Unlike bulky ESP boxes or radar hacks, this one keeps it minimal and sharp. You’ll always know where enemies are, what direction they’re moving, and whether they’re weak — **without making your screen look like a cheat carnival.**

It's the go-to choice for players who want that **"legit" edge** without all the extra noise.
